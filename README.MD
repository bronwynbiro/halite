# Halite Bot


"[Halite](https://halite.io/) is an open source artificial intelligence programming challenge, created by Two Sigma, where players build bots using the coding language of their choice to battle on a two-dimensional virtual board. This year's game is a space story. Your mission is to extract Halite. Bots control ships that dock on and mine planets, producing more ships to defeat opponents. To achieve victory, you will need optimal pathfinding and swarm control to move efficiently from planet to planet and destroy enemy ships."
